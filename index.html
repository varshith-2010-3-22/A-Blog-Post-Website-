              <h3>  <span>üí°</span>Introduction to Psychology</h3>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p> Psychology is the scientific study of mind and behavior . It examines mental processes (thoughts,
             feelings, motives) and actions in humans and animals, both conscious and unconscious . This broad
             discipline spans from brain function to cultural influences, seeking to explain how people think, feel, and
             act. By uncovering patterns in behavior and thought, psychology helps us address issues in mental health,
             education, and society. In fact, psychological knowledge ‚Äúembraces all aspects of the human experience,
             from functions of the brain to actions of nations‚Äù . Its insights aim not only to treat mental illness but
             also to solve real-world problems and benefit society as a whole

             <h3> <span>üå≥</span> Major Psychological Theories</h3>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Psychology has several foundational schools of thought, each offering a different lens on behavior:</p>
        <ol>
            <li> <span class="sp"> ‚öôÔ∏è Behaviorism:</span> Focuses on observable behavior shaped by the environment. Pioneered by John B.
                 Watson and B.F. Skinner, behaviorists view learning as the result of conditioning (e.g. Pavlov‚Äôs
                 classical and Skinner‚Äôs operant conditioning). Skinner argued that behavior is determined by rewards
                  and punishments, with little emphasis on internal thoughts .
            </li><br>
            <li>
                  <span class="sp"> üßä Psychoanalysis: </span>Founded by Sigmund Freud, this theory emphasizes unconscious motives and early
                 childhood experiences. Freud proposed structures of the mind (id, ego, superego) and concepts like
                 defense mechanisms to explain behaviors driven by unconscious conflict . 
            </li><br>
            <li>
                  <span class="sp" > üå± Humanistic Psychology:</span> Developed by Carl Rogers and Abraham Maslow, it views people as
                 inherently good and motivated to achieve self-actualization. This perspective stresses free will,
                 personal growth, and positive human potential. Rogers‚Äôs client-centered therapy and Maslow‚Äôs
                  hierarchy of needs emerged from this approach, highlighting empathy, self-esteem, and fulfillment.

            </li><br>
            <li>
                  <span class="sp"> üß† Cognitive Psychology:</span> This school studies internal mental processes (thinking, memory, language).
                 Emerging as a reaction to behaviorism, it uses experiments to understand how we process
                 information. Jean Piaget‚Äôs work on cognitive development showed how children progress through
                 stages of thinking (sensorimotor ‚Üí preoperational ‚Üí concrete operational ‚Üí formal operational)
                 . Albert Bandura‚Äôs social cognitive theory added that people also learn by observing others and
                 by beliefs in their own efficacy . 
            </li><br>
            <li>
                  <span class="sp"> üß¨ Biological Psychology:</span> Also called biopsychology or behavioral neuroscience, this perspective links
                 biological processes to behavior. It examines how the brain, genes, hormones, and
                 neurotransmitters influence thoughts and actions. For example, research shows that dopamine and
                 serotonin systems affect mood and decision-making, and that damage to specific brain areas (e.g.
                 amygdala, prefrontal cortex) alters emotion and judgment . 
            </li>
        </ol><br>
        <p>      These theories have shaped modern psychology. For instance, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) combines
                 cognitive and behavioral ideas to treat disorders, and neuroscience research has refined the biological view
                 of mind. Each perspective highlights different causes of behavior (environmental, unconscious, free-will  based, 
                 cognitive, or biological), but together they offer a more complete picture of human psychology.
